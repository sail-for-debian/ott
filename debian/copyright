 A formalization of an ML-style module system based on the path based type
 system from section 4 of Xavier Leroy's "A syntactic theory of type
 generativity and sharing", J. Funct. Prog. 1996.  Additionally, I have
 supplied a term language and an operational semantics of my own design.  The
 semantic's key feature is that it never substitutes a structure definition
 because that could duplicate generative type definitions and ruin type
 preservation (the semantics is similar to the semantics for units from my
 ICFP '06 paper/Ph.D. dissertation).  I have modified the type system to
 include an explicit signature ascription construct for structure expressions,
 and I have also modified the subtyping relations in two ways.  One, I have
 used the simpler signature subtyping rules from Leroy's POPL paper (which are
 slightly less general), and two, I have removed rule 33 because it makes
 subtyping non-transitive (a fact which is not mentioned in the papers), and
 it does not have much use outside of the slightly more general form of rule
 33.  Lastly, I omit the "open" construct.
 .
 Several auxiliary functions are defined only for HOL, but are able to use OTT
 notation, almost exclusively, in their definitions.
 .
 The type system treats identifiers as the combination of a name and a stamp,
 with the idea that the stamps can alpha-vary, but the names cannot.  Names
 and stamps are represented with meta-variables of strings and numbers
 respectively.  Identifiers are represented as a non-terminal, instead of as a
 meta-variable represented as a pairs of strings and numbers.  Thus, a
 definition can use "ti" which becomes the HOL variable "ti", or it can use "t
 i" which becomes the HOL expression "Id t i"; other references to just "t" in
 the same rule can thus be automatically coordinated with "ti".  Both ways of

 Ott takes as input a definition of a language syntax and semantics, in a concise
 and readable ASCII notation that is close to what one would write in informal
 mathematics. It can then generate a Coq version of the definition, which requires
 this library.
